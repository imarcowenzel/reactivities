# ðŸ“Œ Project: Backend in .NET with CQRS/MediatR and Frontend in Next.js (React.js)

## ðŸ›  Project Description  

This project involves developing a backend using **.NET 8**, following the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** architecture and utilizing **MediatR** to facilitate communication between handlers. The frontend is built with **React.js** using **Next.js 14**, providing optimized performance and server-side rendering (SSR).  

The primary goal is to structure a **robust and scalable API**, following best development practices, to be consumed efficiently by the frontend.
